## Overview

It is possible to read the contents of any (private, public, or fiends only) post using the edit functionality.

To edit a post, you need its creator's email, and the post ID.

```text
1. register a new user, .e.g email: richard@tu-berlin.de, password: richard:tu-berlin.de
2. create a new post
3. click 'edit' on the post
```

You'll get redirected to a URL like http://localhost:8000/posts/update/richard@tu-berlin.de/20
The scheme is `/posts/update/<email>/<id>`. Both the email and the post ID have to match the creator of the post to
be able to edit it. It is not checked whether the logged in user is actually the creator of the post.

## Attacks

Attack scenario 1:

```text
1. look at the homepage of the app: http://localhost:8000/posts
2. there will be some public posts, with the email and friend status of the posts' creators
3. pick one email, e.g. hanspeter@web.de, and try the urls http://localhost:8000/posts/update/hanspeter@web.de/<1 to 100>
4. if hanspeter@web.de posted one of these posts, you'll see the edit page and can see the post body in the edit field
```

Attack scenario 2:
```text
1. look at the homepage of the app: http://localhost:8000/posts
2. there will be some public posts, with the email and friend status of the posts' creators
3. some emails follow a pattern, e.g. alice.smith@evilcorp.de
4. in some posts, names of people are mentioned, e.g. [...] Ich hatte heute ein tolles Gespr√§ch mit meinem Chef, Hans Gruber [...]
5. because both seem to work at the same company, and the company uses firstname.lastname@evilcorp.de, it is likely that hans.gruber@evilcorp.de also exists
6. try the urls http://localhost:8000/posts/update/hans.gruber@evilcorp.de/<1 to 100>
7. you may find a private post by hans guber
```

## Fixes

Fix the access control of the edit page by verifying that the logged in user is the post creator.
